#summary Flash learning applications that work with the SWF Activity Module.

== Flash elearning applications showcase ==

This wiki page is dedicated to Flash developers who have created learning applications that work with the SWF Activity Module in Moodle. If you have Flash learning applications that you'd like to show off, please comment below with a link to a working demo, preferably in a Moodle course that allows guest access. You can also include links to your personal/organisation's web pages which will hopefully bring more Flash elearning development work your way.

Please only post links directly related to Flash learning applications that can be deployed with the SWF Activity Module in Moodle. I look forward to checking out your work and seeing what wonderful things people are using this project for!
