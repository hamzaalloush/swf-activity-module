= Not released. Do not use yet! =

The latest build of the SWF Activity Module for Moodle includes support for conditional sequencing between SWF course module instances. This means that Flash learning applications can stipulate that learners must successfully complete one SWF module before moving on to the next. The order of the sequence is set by the order of appearance of the module instances on the course page.

== Using the FlashVars class ==

{{{
import com.matbury.sam.data.FlashVars;
// etc...

// Initialise IDs
FlashVars.vars = this.root.loaderInfo.parameters;
private var _currentID:uint = FlashVars.instance;
private var _nextID:uint = FlashVars.nextinstance;

private function checkNextInstance():void {
    if(_currentID == _nextID) {
        // This is the next module in sequence so start
    } else {
        // This isn't the next module.
        // Show user a message and show link to navigate to it
    }
}

// Put your own notifications and navigation here...

// Mouse event handler
private function gotoNextInstance(event:MouseEvent):void {
    var url:String = FlashVars.wwwroot + "mod/swf/view.php?id=" + _nextID;
    var request:URLRequest = new URLRequest(url);
    navigateTo(request,"_self");
}
