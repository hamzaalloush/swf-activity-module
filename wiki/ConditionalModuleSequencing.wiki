The latest build of the SWF Activity Module for Moodle includes support for conditional sequencing between SWF course module instances.

===What is conditional sequecning?===

This is when a group of activities on a course must be completed in a specific order, i.e. learners must complete module 1 before they can attempt module 2. This feature currently only supports one group of SWF Activity Modules per course and the individual modules are selected with a simple true/false option on the module instance configuration form. The order of the sequence is set by the order of appearance of the module instances on the course page.
