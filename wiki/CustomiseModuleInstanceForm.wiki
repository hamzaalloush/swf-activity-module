This page describes how to modify the PHP code in the SWF Activity Module so that you can use either the Moodle file-picker or a drop-down list to select XML files and Flash learning applications.

== How to edit the SWF Activity Module form ==

Find the file moodle/mod/swf/mod_form.php and open it in a text editor.

On lines 100-103 (+/-) you'll see the following code. In this case, it's set to use the file-picker:
{{{
//swfurl - SWF file select/upload
	$mform->addElement('choosecoursefile', 'swfurl', get_string('swfurl', 'swf'), array('courseid'=>$COURSE->id)); // uncomment for file picker
	//$mform->addElement('select', 'swfurl', get_string('swfurl', 'swf'), swf_get_swfs($COURSE->id)); // uncomment for drop down list
}}}

To use the drop-down list, change it to this:
{{{
//swfurl - SWF file select/upload
	//$mform->addElement('choosecoursefile', 'swfurl', get_string('swfurl', 'swf'), array('courseid'=>$COURSE->id)); // uncomment for file picker
	$mform->addElement('select', 'swfurl', get_string('swfurl', 'swf'), swf_get_swfs($COURSE->id)); // uncomment for drop down list
}}}

The drop-down list option searches for .swf files in the Moodle course files directory in a directory called /swf/, i.e. moodledata/[courseid]/swf/. Use the course files manager in Moodle to create the /swf/ directory and upload Flash learning applications to there. The drop-down list option does not search inside subdirectories.
