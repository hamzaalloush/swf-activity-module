#summary Future plans for the SWF Activity Module

== Moodle 1.9 ==

Support and development for Moodle 1.9 will continue for the foreseeable future.

=== 04/03/2011 ===

  * Administration > Modules > Activities > SWF settings panel to be added soon. Set default parameters for new instances on a site wide basis.
  * A full browser Flash feature will soon be added - 100% width, 100% height of browser window.

----

== Moodle 2.0 ==

A new branch will be made eventually, but not any time soon (28/02/2011). Still too many bugs and not enough development time available.

Watch this space!
