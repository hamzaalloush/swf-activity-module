#summary Future plans for the SWF Activity Module

== Moodle 1.9 ==

Support and development for Moodle 1.9 will continue for the foreseeable future.

Currently looking into implementing Moodle user participation reporting. Any help in finding adequate documentation or which functions relate to this would be very helpful.

----

== Moodle 2.0 ==

A new branch will be made eventually, but not any time soon (28/02/2011). Still too many bugs and not enough development time available.

Watch this space!
