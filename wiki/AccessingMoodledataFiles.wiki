This page answers some frequently asked questions about the course media file directories in Moodle and how this affects deploying learning interactions with the SWF Activity Module.

----

== Where are my Flash learning applications stored? ==

If you upload a Flash learning application using the SWF Activity Module upload tool as described on this page, it is stored in the current course's media directory in the /moodledata/ directory.

The numbered directories nested inside /moodledata/ are directories that contain files uploaded for a particular course. You can find out which numbered directory the files for a course are stored in by going to the course page and looking in the browser address bar. You should see something like this:

<img src="http://matbury.com/tutorials/swf_moodledata.gif" width="136" height="291" alt="moodledata course files directories" />

  * `http://MOODLE/course/view.php?id=1`

The number after id= is the number of the course directory. So the course files for the course page above are in /moodledata/1/...

Likewise, if you upload files using the Moodle course files manager, they will be stored in this directory.

Please note that a course directory is only created by Moodle when the first file has been uploaded.

Also, please note that only the contents of the /public_html/ (sometimes called /htdocs/ or /www/) directory are directly accessible on a public server through a web browser. Any files stored outside the public directory must be accessed via a proxy script in the public directory. Luckily, Moodle already has a proxy script at MOODLE/file.php

== How can a Flash learning application access /moodledata/ course files? ==

The easiest way for a Flash learning application to access files stored in a /moodledata/ course directory is to link to them using absolute paths, like this:

  * `http://MOODLE/file.php/1/photos/example_photo_1.jpg`

  * `http://MOODLE/file.php/1/photos/example_photo_2.jpg`

  * `http://MOODLE/file.php/1/audio/example_audio_1.mp3`

  * `http://MOODLE/file.php/1/audio/example_audio_2.mp3`

etc.

The MOODLE/file.php script automatically manages access and permissions so that only users logged in on course can access files stored in the corresponding /moodledata/ course directory. Also, search engines cannot index files stored in /moodledata/.

== Example SMIL XML Playlist ==

Here is an example SMIL XML playlist that accesses files stored in /moodledata/. Note that the course number is 99. If the name if the SMIL XML file is /example_smil_playlist.xml/, then the path to it should be something like:

  * `http://MOODLE/file.php/99/playlists/example_smil_playlist.xml`
