<div class="indent">
<p><strong>Function</strong>: Defines the visual playback quality of the embedded SWF file.</p>
<p><strong>Parameters</strong>:  low, high, autolow, autohigh, best.  </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>low</strong> favors playback speed over appearance and never uses anti-aliasing. </li>
  <li><strong>autolow</strong> emphasizes speed at first but improves  appearance whenever possible. Playback begins with anti-aliasing turned  off. If the Flash Player detects that the processor can handle it,  anti-aliasing is turned on. </li>
  <li><strong>autohigh</strong> emphasizes playback speed and  appearance equally at first but sacrifices appearance for playback  speed if necessary. Playback begins with anti-aliasing turned on. If  the actual frame rate drops below the specified frame rate,  anti-aliasing is turned off to improve playback speed. Use this setting  to emulate the View &gt; Antialias setting in Flash. </li>
  <li><strong>medium</strong> applies some anti-aliasing and does not  smooth bitmaps. It produces a better quality than the Low setting, but  lower quality than the High setting. </li>
  <li><strong>high</strong> favors appearance over playback speed and  always applies anti-aliasing. If the movie does not contain animation,  bitmaps are smoothed; if the movie has animation, bitmaps are not  smoothed. </li>
  <li><strong>best</strong> provides the best display quality and does  not consider playback speed. All output is anti-aliased and all bitmaps  are smoothed. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Default</strong>: best</p>
