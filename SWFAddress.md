# What is SWF Address? #

A common problem with Flash applications is that they do not navigate in the same way as HTML web pages. This means that no matter how many pages or changes in state a user has clicked/navigated through in a Flash application, if she or he hits the browser back button, the browser exits the Flash application and goes to the previous HTML web page. Obviously, this can be annoying for a user who has just spent a lot of time on it.

SWF Address is a combination of Javascript and Actionscript 3.0 classes that add changes in state, such as navigation clicks, to the browser's history and when users click on the browser forward and back buttons, the Flash application can respond accordingly and go to previous and next states, so that it is less likely that users will lose unsaved data or grades.
