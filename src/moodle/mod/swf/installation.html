<h2>Installation</h2>
<h3>How to install the SWF Activity Module</h3>
<p>The SWF Activity Module is the most flexible, functional, robust and powerful way to deploy Flash animations and applications in Moodle 1.9. It supports any version of Flash and Actionscript.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Upload the  /swf/ directory and all its contents to ***YOUR MOODLE***/mod/</li>
  <li>Make sure that the directory structure isn't ***YOUR MOODLE***/mod/swf/swf/... It should be ***YOUR MOODLE***/mod/swf/...</li>
  <li>In Moodle, login as an administrator</li>
  <li>Go to Site Administration &gt; Notifications</li>
  <li>The SWF Activity Module will install/update itself</li>
  <li>If any settings have been changed, you'll be asked to save the settings on the Site Administration &gt; Modules &gt; Activities &gt; SWF page</li>
  <li>That's it!</li>
</ol>
<h3>How to install the AMFPHP Moodle interface</h3>
<p>The AMFPHP service library allows Flash applications  to communicate with Moodle's APIs and services, for example, to push grades into Moodle's grade book, to use Moodle's built in chat and private messaging, and save images and webcam snapshots to the moodledata directories.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Upload the /amfphp/ directory and all its contents to ***YOUR MOODLE***/lib/</li>
  <li>Make sure that the directory structure isn't ***YOUR MOODLE***/lib/amfphp/amfphp/... It should be ***YOUR MOODLE***/lib/amfphp/...</li>
  <li>That's it! It doesn't need to install or modify anything.</li>
